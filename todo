- fix the mobile menu button alignment in the header
- Replace the tooltips with Tippy while keeping the underlines intact
- Make the previously sectioned flex row and hide the locations adding them as title attributes to the images.
- Fix the scrolling overflow which is probably caused by the repositioning of the tooltips
- The menu overlay on mobile when toggled covers the close button which needs to be fixed.
- Now that we're using Tippy, let's add a tooltip to the Texas flag icon within the Austin, Texas section that says yeehaw with a cowboy emoji.
- Center the copyright text in the footer.
